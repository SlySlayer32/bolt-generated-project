# Cross-Platform Backend Integration

    ## Overview

    This project is being built to provide a cross-platform infrastructure for backend integration, optimized for both iOS and Android using React Native.

    ## Technology Stack

    ### Frontend
    - **React Native (v0.64.2)**
    - **Libraries**:
      - Redux for state management
      - React Navigation for routing
      - Axios for API calls
      - react-native-push-notification for push notifications
    - **Tools**:
      - Expo for development
      - Jest for testing

    ### Backend
    - **Node.js with Express.js** for RESTful API services
    - **Python with Django** for handling complex business logic and data processing

    ### Database
    - **PostgreSQL** for relational data storage
    - **Redis** for caching and real-time data updates

    ### APIs
    - **Google Maps API** for location services
    - **Stripe API** for payment processing
    - **Twilio API** for SMS notifications

    ### DevOps
    - **Docker** for containerization
    - **Kubernetes** for orchestration
    - **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipeline
    - **AWS** for cloud services (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudWatch)

    ## Current Stage of Development

    ### What Has Been Done
    - **Initialize Frontend Project:**
      - **Status:** Completed
      - **Percentage:** 100% (Test-ready)
      - **Details:** The React Native project has been initialized using Expo, and the necessary dependencies and configurations are in place.
    - **Backend Setup:**
      - **Node.js + Express:**
        - **Status:** Completed
        - **Percentage:** 100% (Test-ready)
        - **Details:** The Node.js project has been initialized with `npm init`, and a basic Express.js server is set up in the `backend` directory.
    - **Migrated to React Native:** The project now uses React Native (v0.64.2).
    - **Redux Integration:** Redux is set up for state management.
    - **React Navigation Implementation:** React Navigation is implemented for routing, with a basic tab navigator and nested stack navigators.
    - **UI Components Update:** UI components (`Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Modal`) now use React Native components.
    - **Basic App Structure:** The main application structure is set up with Home and Settings screens.
    - **Backend Implementation:**
      - **Node.js with Express.js:** A basic Express.js server is set up in the `backend` directory.
      - **Python with Django:** A basic Django project is set up in the `backend/django_project` directory.
    - **Database Setup:**
      - **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is set up for relational data storage in the Django project.
      - **Redis:** Redis is set up for caching and real-time data updates in the Django project.
    - **Cross-Platform Features:**
      - **Data Binding and API Handling:** Integrated data binding and API handling using Axios.
      - **Push Notifications:** Integrated push notifications using `react-native-push-notification`.
      - **Placeholders for GPS/Location Access and Other Device Capabilities:** Added placeholders for GPS/location access and other device capabilities.

    ### What Remains to Be Done
    - **API Integration:**
      - Integrate Google Maps API for location services.
      - Implement Stripe API for payment processing.
      - Set up Twilio API for SMS notifications.
    - **DevOps Setup:**
      - Implement Docker for containerization.
      - Set up Kubernetes for orchestration.
      - Configure Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline.
      - Set up AWS for cloud services (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudWatch).
    - **Testing:** Implement unit tests and integration tests for the service layers and UI components using Jest.
    - **Complete UI Design and Functionality:** Design and implement the complete user interface and functionality for all screens.
    - **Connect UI to Redux Store:** Connect the UI components to the Redux store for dynamic updates and state management.
    - **Implement Service Layer Logic:** Implement the logic for the service layers (`AuthService`, `DataService`, etc.) to interact with the backend.
    - **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API requests and other potential errors.
    - **Security:** Add security measures such as token management and data encryption.
    - **Documentation:** Expand the README with detailed instructions, API endpoints, and usage examples.
